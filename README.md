## BW_WOD_Generator_DEMO v1.0 

Demo program that generates a bodyweight Work Out of the Day.

The purpose of this project was to create a working skeleton of a program that randomly generates a Workout of The Day (WOD) using only bodyweight exerciseâ€™s. 

# Workout Types

AMRAP: 

AMRAP stands for As Many Rounds as Possible (AMRAP). To do an AMRAP, select a series of exercises and a prescribed amount of time in which to complete as many rounds or reps of the designated moves as you can within a given timeframe.

EMOM:

EMOM stands for Every Minute on the Minute (EMOM). An EMOM workout is a form of interval training. The challenge is to complete a predetermined number of repetitions (reps) of a particular exercise within 60 seconds. Then, you use whatever time is left in that minute to rest before moving on to the next set.

CHIPPER:

A Chipper is a workout in which you complete the repetitions stated of each exercise before moving onto the next. It is usually a longer or more endurance focused WOD.

HERO: 

A Hero WOD is the definition itself, which is to honor and pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the fallen military, law enforcement, and first responder personnel. The workouts are often named after a specific individual who has made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. These workouts are intended to be intense and challenging to help reflect the dedication, bravery, and sacrifice of the heroes they honor.
